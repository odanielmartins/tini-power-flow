# tini-power-flow
A very small PHP program to read a .CSV file containing some values of an electric power system and produce a power flow estimate. Only very simplified systems are advised. The number of bus bars must also ve very limitated. It is a program to use under command line. The notarion and language used to define your power system are, we expect, detailed on top comments of the program. We beleive there are no exigencies about PHP interpreter version. If anyone ever finds a problem, please contact author (odanielmartins@gmail.com).
