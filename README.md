# tini-power-flow
A very small Octave/Matlab program to read a .CSV file containing some values of an electric power system and produce a power flow estimate. Only very simplified systems are advised. The number of bus bars must also ve very limitated. tHIS is a program to be used under command line. The notation and language used to define your power system are, we expect, detailed inside ex4Bars.csv. We beleive there are no restrictions about Octave ou Matlab interpreter version. If anyone ever finds a problem, please contact author (odanielmartins@gmail.com).
